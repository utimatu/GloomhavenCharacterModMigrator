Hello everyone!

This is my first mod for a game that I've ever made, so I'm sorry if it is not polished.  

This mod intents to help with an issue with Gloomhaven modding in which mods such as the Sun-Brute mod, which requires the overwriting of a character to use.  Therefore, if you wanted to play with a group including both Sun and Brute, you will be unable to.  This mod (or executable as it were) fixes this by creating a new mod with relinked data elements, allowing you to change the class that gets overwritten to whatever you want.  

In order to use this mod, you can either download the source and run it with a python interpretter (recommended only if you have experience dealing with python package management) or you can download the release and run the executable.

I believe this only works on Windows and is probably going to cause lots of bugs if it is used on OSX.  Once it starts, you will see the worst ui you have ever seen.  But select the Mod Config folder that you want to edit for, then select the Mod folder for the character mod.  Once it has finished loading the data, you can select which character you want to be overwritten.  It will place a new mod into the GloomMods folder which can be added in-game.

Please let me know how it works, I have only done limited testing.
